My Garage

The My Garage app was created so that you can keep track of your car's maintenance records.  The app allows you to add a car to the database.  Once a car has been added to the database, you will be able to view all of the maintenance records on file for that specific vehicle.  If you sell or lose your car, you can also delete the car from your database.
